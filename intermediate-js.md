     a function as an argument and/or returns a function.
     
    -.map() does something to every item in an array & returns the same length/size

     -Testing is important to test for bugs before development

5. What is a higher order function?

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

     -I learned that I'm going to need to put in more work to get where I want to be in this class. I definitely do not
      want to go through this program and feel like I am behind in anyway. If that means staying later everyday to 
      understand concepts, and doing extra studying on the weekends, then that's what I need to do. 
      I looked at this group project as a wake-up call for myself to do better.
